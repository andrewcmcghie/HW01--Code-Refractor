# HW01--Code-Refractor
First homework
For this assignment we had to make small changes to the tags in the html. I changed several div tags to more semantic tags as well as changing the title of the website and adding alt information for all of the images attached. 
Line 10 <!-- Input the company name as the title.-->
Line 17 <!-- Changed the div tag to a header tag-->
Line 20 <!--cleaned up this list a little-->
Line 34 <!--Added section tag-->
Line 62 <!--changed div tag to article tag-->
Line 88 <!--Changed div tag to footer tag-->
